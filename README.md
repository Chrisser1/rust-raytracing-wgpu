# Rust Raytracing with WGPU

## Introduction
This project aims to explore GPU programming and ray tracing using the wgpu library in Rust. Ray tracing simulates the way light interacts with objects to create realistic images. By leveraging the parallel processing power of GPUs with Rust's performance and safety, we aim to implement a basic yet efficient ray tracing engine.

## Objectives
- Understand the basics of GPU programming.
- Learn the principles of ray tracing.
- Implement a ray tracing engine using Rust and wgpu.

## Setup
To get started with this project, ensure you have Rust and Cargo installed on your system. Follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Chrisser1/rust-raytracing-wgpu.git
